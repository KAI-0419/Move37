# Move 37 - Game Instructions

## Objective
Defeat the AI by either:
1. Capturing the enemy **King**.
2. Moving your **King** to the opposite end of the board (Row 0 for Player).

## Pieces & Movement
- **King (K):** Moves 1 step in any direction (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal).
- **Knight (N):** Moves in an 'L' shape (2 steps one way, 1 step perpendicular), jumps over pieces.
- **Pawn (P):** 
  - Moves forward 1 step.
  - Captures diagonally forward 1 step.
  - *Note:* Pawns cannot move backward.

## Gameplay
1. **Your Turn (White/Cyan):** Click on one of your pieces to select it. Valid moves will be highlighted (or just try to move). Click a destination square.
2. **AI Turn (Black/Red):** The AI (Move 37) will analyze the board and make a move.
3. **Reasoning:** Watch the terminal log. The AI will explain its move using its "Alien Logic".

## Tips
- **Sacrifice:** Sometimes losing a piece is necessary to open a path for your King.
- **Aggression:** The board is small (5x5). Contact happens immediately. Be aggressive.
- **Pattern Recognition:** The AI prioritizes material and advancement. Use this against it.

Good luck, human.
